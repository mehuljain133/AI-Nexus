# 🌼 IrisWise - Iris Species Prediction Model 🌺 (https://ainexusiriswise.streamlit.app/)

Welcome to **IrisWise**! This application predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features using various machine learning models. Currently, it implements K-Nearest Neighbors, with plans to include more models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface:** 🖥️ Enjoy a sleek, modern UI with custom styling, animations, and colorful themes, enhancing the overall user experience. The interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging.

- **Multiple Machine Learning Models:** 📊 Choose from a variety of models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and more. Each model is evaluated for performance to provide the best possible prediction.

- **Real-time Predictions:** 🌸 Input the features of the Iris flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and get an instant prediction of the species.

- **Dynamic Visualizations:** 📈 Explore decision boundaries and model performance graphs that update dynamically as you interact with the app. The visualizations help in understanding the decision process of each model.

- **Tooltips and Explanations:** 💡 Hover over options and checkboxes to get detailed tooltips, making the app more informative and easier to use.

- **Custom Animations:** 🎨 Experience unique animations and transitions, including Lottie and JavaScript animations, that enhance the visual appeal of the app. **(Working On It...)**

## Customization

You can customize the app to your liking by modifying the CSS for styling, updating the machine learning models, or adding new features. The code is well-documented to help you navigate and tweak the application as needed.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project as you see fit!
